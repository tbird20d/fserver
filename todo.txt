To Do file for fserver:
 - extract run data into a directory (per run)
 - add support for labs
 - add support for boards
   - have board json files, but it has very few attributes


Postponed for now:
 - add security
   - require authentication itself to add, update or remove requests
   - require authentication to add tests or binary packages

 - eliminate pages directory
   - don't create tbwiki file for request in do_put_request
 - integrate FuegoShow into fserver.py
   - is fuego integration being added or removed?

= security notes =
     - use otp file (lab-<labname>.otp) to authenticate operations
       - use for only certain operations:
         - submission of requests, tests, binary-packages
         - change of state for requests
       (others operations don't need security, unless server is private)
         - is this correct
     - algorithm to use the file is:
       - on client side:
         - select offset
           - generate random offset (multiple of 32)
         - seek to that offset
           - read file (32 bytes), is value is zero, start over
             - if start over too many times, search linearly for next
                non-zero address, starting from last seek position
           - zero out the bytes at the offset
           - sync file
         - send (labname, offset and value) with operation
       - on server side:
         - select file using labname
         - seek to offset read value
           - keep a log of operations, per lab: IP, offset, time
           - prevent DOS attack by limiting operations to once per second
         - zero out bytes at the offset
         - compare sent and read values
           - if no match, reject request
           - if match, accept request
       - create tool to show percent used of otp file
