Here are some notes about fserver - the Fuego server implementation.

Files:
 fserver.py - the Fuego server
 fserver-server.py - a python web server (supports CGI) for testing purposes
 start_server - a shell script to start the test server

Data Files:
 in the 'files' directory:
  * tests - has tests that have been uploaded to the server
  * requests - has requests that were put to the server
  * runs - has runs that were put to the server

The server itself is a CGI script, written in python

== user interface ==
It handles showing a user interface to examine the objects on the server.

It can show lists of objects, and the content of individual objects.

== programatic interface ==
It also handles requests from ftc to put, update, query, and remove objects.

The server is a "dumb store", in that it doesn't do any intelligent handling
of the data, or any visualization. It's primary purpose is to allow sharing
of objects bewteen Fuego users and labs.

current objects supported are: tests, run requests, runs.

Other objects that might be supported in the future include:
 - labs, hosts, boards, pass-criteria, reviews, users?
 - hosts, labs and users might one-time-pad encryption keys
