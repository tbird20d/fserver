Here are some notes about the python cgi module:

looks for the following environment variables:
 REQUEST_METHOD (for GET or POST or HEAD)
 CONTENT_TYPE
 QUERY_STRING
 CONTENT_LENGTH

HTTP headers that are examined:
 content-type
 content-disposition

for form values, you can test the field's 'file' attribute to
see if the item is a file:
ex: if form["file1"].file:
      <process the value as a file>

File attributes are, by default, placed in a temporary file, and the
file is read when the form value is accessed:
   fileitem = form["file1"]
